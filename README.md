## ðŸš€ Get Started Without Git History

If you want to use this as a clean starter project:

```bash
git clone --branch Game-Focus --single-branch https://github.com/youruser/JFrameTemplate.git MyApp
cd MyApp
rm -rf .git               # to: remove Git history
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Reinitialize with New Git

You can optionally include this too:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
> ðŸ’¡ This repo uses multiple branches as independent templates.
> You do NOT need to create pull requests between them.
